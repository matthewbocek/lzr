				I was commissioned by seven animation students at The One Academy in Malaysia 
				to compose the music for their animated short after being recommended by their 
				lecturer. I delivered a high quality orchestral score in about five days after 
				receiving a draft of the short. I just wrote/produced the music. I did not help
				with sound effects or voices.
