				I was asked to create a jazz score for The Beast, and so I employed a 
				small combo to perform the music. It features Evan Sadler on clarinet, 
				Eytan Nicholson on the drums, and myself on the piano. The other instruments 
				are sampled. I did not create the sound effects for this animation.
